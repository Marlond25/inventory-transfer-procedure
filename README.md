I created this tool to be the fastest in my job :P

It is a data processing tool that I was able to automate in order to load a type of document called RQI into a database using a POST request to an HTML service, it involves, extracting data, processing that data, parsing as JSON and finally posting it as I said.

This will later be read into a Microsoft Power BI dataset to keep track of important this, some indicators and some cool graphs.
